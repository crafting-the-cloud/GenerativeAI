Utilitarian wear is in for 2023, which sets the stage for the return of the cargo pant. But these aren't the shapeless, low-rise pants of the Y2K era. For spring, this trend is translated into tailored silhouettes, interesting pocket placements, elevated fabrics like silk and organza, and colors that go beyond khaki and olive.\n",

In 2023,  naked dressing makes its way from the red carpet – where celebrities like Cher and Rihanna have been sporting the trend forever – to street style.

From double-waisted jeans to carpenter jeans, it's been a while since we were this excited about denim trends. It seems like even the most luxe runway designers agree, sending out strapless dresses, shirting, and even undergarments and shoes (thigh-high-boot-jean hybrids anyone?) in the material.

The amount of shine on the 2023 runways would make you think we are back in the Roaring '20s. While sequins may feel over as soon as the clock strikes midnight on January 31, this year, designers are making a case for \"daytime shine\" – wearable separates that can spice up even the most basic staples like tank tops (see above) and blue jeans. While this trend comes in all metallic shades (gold, bronze, rose gold etc.), we are partial to the liquid silver look that can double as a neutral.\n",

In response to the ultra unpractical mini skirts of 2022, maxi skirts are here to dominate the year. In line with the aforementioned cargo and denim trends, expect lots of low-rise, pocket-adorned silhouettes and floor-grazing jean skirts, as well as styles in various prints and unexpected materials like velvet.

The strongest color story to come out of Spring 2023 runways, cobalt blue has burst through the collections with the freshness of a sea mist on a morning day.

Sequins and shiny finishes showed up on too many catwalks to count, meaning it’s high time to add a little flash to your rotation. There’s no wrong approach, whether you go for a metallic miniskirt or chrome shoes.\n",

As cute as they can be, tiny bags aren’t the most practical accessories. But we’ve got great news: Brands supersized their purses this spring, showing styles that have plenty of room for groceries, laptops, hardcover books, and pretty much anything else you could want on your person. If you’re on the hunt for a new work bag, this is your sign that bigger is officially better.\n",

Denim remains just as baggy this season as it has been—if not even looser than before. A great light-wash pair of jeans has virtually endless styling potential; take a cue from Bottega Veneta and pair yours with a worn-in flannel or play with denim-on-denim à la Bally. \n",

I recently wore Prada’s satin midi skirt during New York Fashion Week, which debuted on the designer’s spring 2023 runway in Milan last fall.

These bold, cherry red pants from High Sport are my starting point: their vibrant hue is as immediately uplifting as it is unexpected.

For his spring collection, he sent out pieces down the runway which featured, yes, his signature bouclé tweeds but also pieces adorned with gold braided shoulder straps and gold piping.
